As part of the Mastered Bootcamp, I decided to challenge myself by designing and programming a stealth game in Unity, primarily to explore how to create detailed game AI.


Main features:
- Enemy AI that makes use of Unity's navigation system, written using the State design pattern.
- A 'teleport' ability - player can move invisibly around the level (within a time limit) to choose a spot to teleport to.
- A 'distraction' ability - player can place an object that emits a spooky sound, drawing any nearby enemies to that location.
