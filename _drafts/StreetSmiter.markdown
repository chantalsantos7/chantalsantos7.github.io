I am a Unity developer for a project called Street Smiter, in collaboration with fellow creators from the Mastered bootcamp. We submitted a prototype for consideration for the WINGS ELEVATE Game Accelerator 2023 grant and were the first runner-up.
I was initially brought on to help implement gameplay features, then after the prototype submission I took charge of refactoring the code base.

My role:
- Implemented a modular events-based architecture using Scriptable Objects, which enables extension of the game through the Unity Editor
- Wrote technical documentation for how to use the new events system.
