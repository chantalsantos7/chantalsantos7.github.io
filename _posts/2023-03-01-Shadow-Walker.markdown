For the Mastered Bootcamp, I decided to challenge myself by designing and programming a stealth game, to explore how to create a detailed game AI.


Key features include:
- Enemy AI that makes use of Unity's navigation system, written using the State design pattern.
- A 'teleport' ability that lets you move invisibly around the level for a short time, then moves you to your new location.
- A 'distraction' ability lets you place an object that emits a spooky sound, drawing any nearby enemies to that location.
