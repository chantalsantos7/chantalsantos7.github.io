As part of the Mastered Bootcamp, I decided to challenge myself by designing and programming a stealth game in Unity, primarily to explore how to create detailed game AI.


Main features:
- Enemy AI that makes use of Unity's navigation system, written using the State design pattern.
- A 'teleport' ability - player can move invisibly around the level (within a time limit) to choose a spot to teleport to.
- A 'distraction' ability - player can place an object that emits a spooky sound, drawing any nearby enemies to that location.


### **Street Smiter**

I am a Unity Developer for a mobile game project based on the Cantonese custom of 'villain hitting'. We submitted a prototype for consideration for the WINGS ELEVATE Game Accelerator 2023 grant and were the first runner-up.


My responsibilities:
- Implementing gameplay features for the prototype.
- Implementing a modular event-driven architecture using Scriptable Objects for the alpha version, making it easier for disparate systems to interact with each other.
- Writing technical documentation for the systems I am responsible for.
